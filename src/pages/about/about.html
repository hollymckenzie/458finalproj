<p>Holly McKenzie: Authentication - Used firebase. There is a log in section where you can log in with any email/password combo that was created through the sign up section. The sign up page gives an error if the email is not a valid email and an error if the password is shorter than 6 characters. Upon signing up the account is added to Firebase, and you can now use that account on the sign in page in the future. You can also sign in with your google account, which gives you sign in, sign out, change password, and forgot password capabilities. These accounts are also added to Firebase. The side menu displays your email if you are signed in and has a log out option. If you are not signed in this button is a log in option. Both work properly. As another extra feature, the line under the email and password entry boxes turns red when the input is not accepted, and green when it is.</p>
<p>Ellen Carriere: Created, linked, and utilized database. Made database with Firebase realtime database and imported a json file. Linked database using many resources and trial and error. Holly was doing the authentication, and her part was done on time. My portion, the database, was the part that was held up and is the reason it was turned in late. I was able to get the database to display the information on the console, but struggled to get it to display on the actual site. The late points should be deducted for my grade. When you go to the All Categories page and inspect it, you can see the values of the movies displayed in the console.</p>
<p>Note: our program pulls from a database, but it does not write to a database becuase this is not a functionality of our app. There is no way to implement this. We spoke to Joey about it on 10/24, and he said it was fine.</p>
